The available commands are:

To load basic defeasible logic
create a new file and then
- require './defeasible'

To populate a theory

- Rule.new('label', 'head', 'body1',...,'bodyN')
- rule('label', 'head', 'body1',...,'bodyN')
- sup('label','label')

or call a name of a theory

To show a theory
- theory

To compute the (positive) extension
- prove
- prove('dft') (for triggering the transformation for defeaters)

To show the (positive) extension
- show_conclusions
